			<p>
				A hyperstructure is a blockchain protocol that is designed with the following core principles:
				<br><br>
				• Unstoppable: Blackhole’s infrastructure is decentralized and cannot be halted by anyone. 
				It runs as long as the underlying blockchain exists, ensuring continuity in the market.<br>
				• Permissionless: Blackhole is universally accessible and censorship-resistant. It offers 
				open access for builders and users, ensuring that no one is deplatformed.<br>
				• Low Fees: Blackhole operates with minimal fees, which are barely noticeable to users, 
				making it cost-efficient and user-friendly.<br>
				• Credibly Neutral: The protocol operates without any bias towards specific users. Everyone 
				has equal access to the system.<br>
				• Valuable: As a valuable protocol, Blackhole generates economic incentives and opportunities 
				for users, while the accrued value is accessible to its owners.<br>
				• Expansive: Blackhole incentivizes participation across a wide range of users and developers, 
				ensuring broad ecosystem engagement.<br>
				• Positive-Sum: Blackhole creates a win-win environment for all participants. It ensures that 
				every user benefits from using the same infrastructure, creating a collaborative and thriving market.<br>

			<p>
				Leveraging multiple blockchains, including EVM networks and Solana, Blackhole’s aggregation 
				mechanism creates an infrastructure that is unstoppable. Its decentralized nature ensures 
				that once the protocol is live, it cannot be censored or controlled by any central authority. 
				This makes it a true public good for the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.
				<br><br>
				Thanks to low transaction fees and fast processing times across supported networks, Blackhole 
				brings liquidity aggregation to a new level, offering a seamless experience with near-zero 
				fees for users, while still allowing for sustainable incentives to those who contribute to 
				the ecosystem.
				<br><br>
				Blackhole’s architecture, which spans across EVM chains and Solana, offers users a unified 
				interface for accessing the best possible pricing and liquidity across multiple platforms. 
				It enables easy trade routing and access to the most optimal assets within the ecosystem, 
				creating a robust, resilient, and expansive environment.

			<p class="name"><span>/2/</span> Why Hyperstructure?</p>
			<p>
				At Blackhole, we believe that hyperstructures are not just isolated endpoints; they are stepping stones 
				to a greater ecosystem. While many view hyperstructures as self-sustaining systems, their true purpose 
				is to serve as a foundation for further innovations in the decentralized space.
				<br><br>
				These protocols are designed with long-term sustainability in mind—acting as the cornerstone upon 
				which additional protocols and infrastructure can be built. They are not simply finished products;
				they are launchpads that help other protocols thrive and grow within a given ecosystem. In this 
				sense, they are like the base plate in a Lego set—something on which you can continue to build 
				endlessly, with each addition creating further complexity and value.
				<br><br>
				Blackhole Aggregator is our core product, designed to act as this foundational structure within 
				the EVM and Solana ecosystems. While our current offering is highly usable and optimized for speed, 
				it is just the beginning of a broader vision. The aggregator itself will eventually link with a 
				range of additional features, tools, and protocols we are working to build in the future.
				<br><br>
				Though we are still in development, Blackhole aims to be a free public good, open for anyone to use, 
				with the primary goal of optimizing decentralized finance. It is not entirely decentralized at this 
				stage, but our approach is to empower the broader community to build upon this infrastructure, 
				creating a more robust ecosystem that offers long-term value to all participants.
				<br><br>
				Just as other protocols are layered on top of traditional blockchain infrastructure, we see 
				Blackhole as a critical element in a growing DeFi ecosystem, one that will continually expand and evolve.
